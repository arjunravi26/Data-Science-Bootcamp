    "* This parameter controls the \"neighborhood size.\"\n",

    "\n",
    "* Core Points: Points that have at least MinPts neighbors (including itself) within the radius ε.\n",

    "1. Automatic Outlier Detection:\n",
    "* DBSCAN automatically labels points that don't belong to any cluster as noise, making it highly robust to outliers.\n",

    "2. Clusters of Arbitrary Shapes:\n",
    "* Unlike K-Means, which forms spherical clusters, DBSCAN can identify clusters of arbitrary shapes (e.g., elongated, curved).\n",
